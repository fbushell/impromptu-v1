####Dyna Reem Shopify Theme 
This is based on the Atlantic theme


The SASS directory is located one level above the theme folder so we don't clutter up the `assets/` folder. We preproccess the .sass files from the `sass/` folder into a css file within the `sasss/` folder. We then run an autoprefixer on the outputed css file before placing it into the `assets/` folder

To get started 
```
$ npm install
```

To develop run
```
$ grunt
```
